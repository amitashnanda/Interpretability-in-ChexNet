This folder contains 2 '.ipynb' files for the code implementation of the project:

1) 'pneumonia_detection_shap.ipynb' performs pneumonia classification on the Chest X-ray images based on the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge Dataset with various models, and also implements model interpretability using SHAP.

2) 'multiclass_classification.ipynb' performs multi-class classification of pulmonary diseases on chest x-ray images based on NIH Chest X-ray Dataset Sample with ResNet18.

The major library requirements are:

1) pytorch
2) tensorflow
3) numpy
4) matplolib
5) shap
6) scikit-learn
7) pandas
8) opencv
